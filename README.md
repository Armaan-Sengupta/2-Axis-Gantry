The project was the MTE 325 Two-Axis Machine Project, which focused on building and programming an embedded system to control a two-axis machine using an STM32 Nucleo board and motor driver shield. The lab manual outlined objectives such as learning to implement interrupts and polling, configuring GPIO, using UART, characterizing an ADC, integrating limit switches, controlling motors, and finally demonstrating precise positioning of the machine
